# Blind_MCQTest
Visually impaired people generally cannot attend their tests on their own, without anyone else's help. Currently, blind people take tests using braille or with the assistance of a writer who performs on their behalf. The proposed application is designed for blind people so that they can appear for their tests without any assistance. It is also useful for other handicapped people with upper limb disabilities. The system is based on Speech Synthesis (text-to-speech conversion) for dictating questions to the blind candidate with the help of Googleâ€™s Speech Synthesis API. Their responses are recorded through voice. It also assists examiners / teachers in manipulating the questions. HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, and Google Web Speech API are used to develop this application.
